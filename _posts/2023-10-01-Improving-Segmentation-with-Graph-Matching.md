Maynooth University researcher Dr. Jeremy Chopin recently published his PhD work within the journal Computer Vision and Image Understanding [DOI:10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103744](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103744). 

Titled **Model-based inexact graph matching on top of DNNs for semantic scene understanding** , 
the work aims to improve 2D and 3D image segmentation performed by deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Transformers by introducting a post-processing step matching a model graph (capturing spatial relationships between regions) with the one found with AI segmentation.  

Co-authors include Rozenn Dahyot (Maynooth University), Harold Mouchère (Nantes Université), Jean-Baptiste Fasquel (Université d’Angers), Isabelle Bloch (Sorbonne Université). 

Dr. Jeremy Chopin completed his PhD in Angers University (2022) and then joined Maynooth University as part of the [SFI research centre ADAPT](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/news-and-events/adapt-researcher-publishes-work-aiming-to-improve-2d-and-3d-image-segmentation-in-the-journal-computer-vision-and-image-understanding/).
